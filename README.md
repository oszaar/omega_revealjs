# <%= title %> Format

## Installing

*TODO*: Replace the `<github-organization>` with your GitHub organization.

```bash
quarto use template <github-organization>/<%= filesafename %>
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that you can use as a starting place for your article.

## Using

*TODO*: There is an ugly workaround for the title-slide. The goal was to have a vertical split in color but could not manage to fill the entire screen. For now I use a svg image and when switching to group slides I switch to the black background.
